This is an old Project. I decided to put at GitHub some old code I have found saved in old CDs.

Sample HTTP Server Skeleton in C#

This particular Sample I first publish it at CodeProject.com
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17071/Sample-HTTP-Server-Skeleton-in-C

It appears to be quite popular since, and is being used in many projects. Maybe I should updated it for new .Net Frameworks and bug fixes.
